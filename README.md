# AWS Boto3 Python Snippets

 This repository is my collection of useful code snippets for working with various AWS services using Boto3 in Python.

 ## Description

AWS offers a wide range of cloud services. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, and more. 
This repository aims to provide simple, straightforward examples and use-cases to help you integrate AWS services into your applications.

## Getting Started

- Python 3.x
- Boto3 library
- AWS account

To install Boto3, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install boto3
```
### Setting Up AWS Credentials

Before you can start using these snippets, make sure you have set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by installing the AWS CLI and running:

```bash
aws configure
```

### How to Use the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the script you want to use.
